Amazon-Inspired UI: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Deep Dive

I recently built an Amazon-inspired user interface using only pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project was a hands-on challenge to master core web technologies without frameworks.

I focused on:
 * HTML Structure: Creating a semantic and accessible blueprint for complex layouts, including navigation, product grids, and footers.
 * CSS Craftsmanship: Implementing responsive design with Flexbox and CSS Grid to achieve pixel-perfect layouts across devices. I finessed styling for product cards, search bars, and interactive elements.
 * JavaScript Dynamics: Bringing the UI to life with vanilla JavaScript. I built a dynamic image carousel, simulated interactive search functionality, and developed client-side logic for an "add to cart" feature, all without external libraries.

This project significantly enhanced my skills in problem-solving, debugging, and understanding client-side logic. It solidified my ability to build robust, interactive, and visually appealing front-end applications from the ground up
